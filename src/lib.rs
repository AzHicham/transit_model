//! The `transit_model` crate proposes a model to manage transit data.
//! It can import and export data from
//! [GTFS](https://gtfs.org/reference/static) and
//! [NTFS](https://github.com/CanalTP/ntfs-specification/blob/master/ntfs_fr.md).
//!
//! # Features
//! `transit_model` has 2 possible features: `proj` and `xmllint`.
//!
//! ## `proj`
//! `proj` feature is used for geolocation conversion (see
//! [Proj]). `proj` feature is used, for example, to export NeTEx France format.
//!
//! [Proj]: https://proj.org
//!
//! ## `xmllint`
//! Most likely, you don't need this feature as it's only used for additional
//! tests. It doesn't add any functionality to `transit_model`. If you're a
//! contributor to the project, you might be interested to run these tests. In
//! this case, take a look at the [`CONTRIBUTING.md`] for more information on
//! this feature.
//!
//! ## `mutable-model`
//! This is an experimental feature that allows you to get some abilities to
//! mutate a `Model`. It might not be completely stable at the moment so use
//! with care (or not at all!).
//!
//! [`CONTRIBUTING.md`]: https://github.com/CanalTP/transit_model/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
